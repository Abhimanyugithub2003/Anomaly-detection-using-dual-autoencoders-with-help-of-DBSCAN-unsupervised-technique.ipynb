# Anomaly-detection-using-dual-autoencoders-with-help-of-DBSCAN-unsupervised-technique.ipynb
A robust system for identifying sensor faults and ecological events by employing a dual-autoencoder architecture: the first autoencoder uses wavelet transforms for signal reconstruction to detect transient spikes, while the second operates in the feature domain to identify systematic drift, with consensus scoring for high-fidelity anomaly alerts.


OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION (Provide minimum two)
Design dual autoencoder architecture that purpose is to detect anomalies environment sensor data, anomalies types involves both transient (sudden spikes) and systematic (slow deviation).
2. Precise and robust anomaly identification by combining deep learning with wavelet-based signal reconstruction.
Design model for scalable deployment of massive, diverse crowdsourced environmental sensor network.
Inherit consensus scoring between the autoencoders, which lead to improvement in detection accuracy and decrease false positive(alarms).


PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY THE INVENTION:  
Environmental interference, calibration drift, and sensor malfunctions cause data quality degradation in current environmental sensor networks. While supervised models require labelled defect data, which are infrequently available, manual validation is unfeasible at scale. This innovation provides autonomous anomaly detection in dynamic, dispersed sensing systems by doing away with the need for manual calibration and labelled datasets.
